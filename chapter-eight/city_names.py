# Exercise 8-6: City Names

def city_country(city, country):
    return city.title() + ", " + country.title()

print(city_country("naples", "united states"))
print(city_country("chicago", "united states"))
print(city_country("lake bluff", "united states"))

# return is where function ends
# not every function needs return
# function with return statement expects input and gives you output
# so return is output statment
